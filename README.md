The code implements a genetic algorithm in which a class named Individual is created with a method to randomly genotype an individual with probability 0.5 to assign a value of 1 or 0 to each gene. Once this binary genotype is generated, we must verify if it works correctly, creating 1000 individuals that have a genotype of length 4. In addition, to observe the data we implement a graph that shows the number of "1" in the entire population for each position of the genotype itself. Finally, we have to make it possible to specify limits on the values of each gene in the initialization function (Individual) and check that this method works correctly, by making a histogram of the distribution of these values in the population.
This code will potentially show a clear visualization of the population generated with their genotype boundaries and 


The main framework is specified with the following diagram:
