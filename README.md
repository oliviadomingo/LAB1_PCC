The code implement a genetic algorithm to solve the following problem:  create a method in a class named Individual to set a binary genotype randomly with probability 0.5 t assign a value of 1 or 0 to each gene. Once this binary genotype is generated we have to check if it works correctly creating 1000 individuals with genotype of lenght 4 and making a graph that shows the number of "1" in the population at each position.
- modify the initialization function so that the number of genes is 1
- what is the state of the art?
- what is the problem/limitation of the state of the art?
- how do you aim to improve it?

Make sure you cite the sources that you report. Two consicutive citations [1,2] usually separated by comma [2,3], three or more consecutive citations are generally separated by dash [1-3].

Go to the Wiki tab and fill in all of the details, making a nice presentation of the analyses there.


Consider including a nice diagram that shows the main framework:
